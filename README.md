# BTC-history-trade
This program is gonna trade BTC's history chart by using some indicators and then return results

Program is gonna have some Take Profit(TP) and Stop Loss(SL) points. There is indicators like RSI,MACD etc. I'm going to learn how to understand these indicators and implement it to the program

By using program we can understand how indicators works and how can we use them . and also I can create a trading boy by using AI includes past trades on this program.

Gonna be hard and long journey for me. I am sure I gonna learn plenty of things on this journey both of coding and trading.
